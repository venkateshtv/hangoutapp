    "Description": "Thalankuppam is a small fishing hamlet, at Ennore, the extreme north of Chennai city. The Thalankuppam River, also called as the Kourtaliayaar, Mogathwaram, meets the sea this place.  Around 200 years ago, this is the place the British would come to, sailing 17 kilo meters from Fort St. George and buy their lord’s favorite here. Even today, people flock in the early hours to buy loads of fresh fish. It has also won its place for climax shots in a few movies."

In the serene suburb of Thiruvanmiyur, the apartment No F-2 on 3, Seward Road in Valmiki Nagar, stands out—it has the dubious distinction of being a bhoot bangla.
